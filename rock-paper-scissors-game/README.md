Rock Paper Scissors README

This folder contains some of my first attempts at python programming.

rock-paper-scissors v1
    a basic r,p,s game that asks the user for an input and declares the winner.

rock-paper-scissors v2
    Pretty much the same game, the code has been altered to include nested if/elif and reworked so that if the same item is selected by each player it will, display the result, and no longer check the rest of the code.

rock-paper-scissors vs computer
    Included a version using a randint to act as player2
